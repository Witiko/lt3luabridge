MODIFICATION ADVICE:

If you want to customize this file, it is best to make a copy of
the source file(s) from which it was produced.  Use a different
name for your copy(ies) and modify the copy(ies); this will ensure
that your modifications do not get overwritten when you install a
new release of the standard system.  You should also ensure that
your modified source file does not generate any modified file with
the same name as a standard file.

You will also need to produce your own, suitably named, .ins file to
control the generation of files from your source file; this file
should contain your own preambles for the files it generates, not
those in the standard .ins files.

The names of the source files used are shown above.
